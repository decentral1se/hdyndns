Any DNS provider can be supported if they provide some programmatic way to
update their DNS records (for example, if they have a public API). If your
current DNS provider is not listed above, please `raise an issue`_. If you'd
like to add it yourself, take a look at `hdyndns/providers.py`_. All
contributions welcome!
