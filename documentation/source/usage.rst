> A Local Update Client
>
> If your router doesn’t support DDNS services, you will need a local client to
> run on a frequently used computer somewhere on your home network. This
> lightweight little application will check what your IP address is and then
> phone home to the DDNS provider to update your DDNS record. It’s less ideal
> than a router-based solution–if the computer isn’t on when your IP address
> changes, then the record doesn’t get updated–but it’s certainly better than
> manually editing your DDNS entry.

This tool is the 'Local Update Client' component of the Dynamic DNS hombrew setup.
